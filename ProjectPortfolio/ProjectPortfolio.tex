\summary
{
This project aims to convert and extend the Lindenmayer-system based tree construction 
method presented by \citep{prusinkiewicz1996systems} to be used as an independent 
OpenGL module. 
The module should allow the addition of trees to a real-time environment with minimal 
user interaction, avoiding the difficulties and expenses of manually producing tree 
models.
