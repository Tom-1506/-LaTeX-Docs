\section{Introduction}
This section will provide a brief description of the project, the areas of 
knowledge required to complete the project and a general roadmap for the projects 
progression.

\subsection{Description}
Generating natural environments can be costly. Creating and rendering realistic 
models of trees can be challenging. This projects goal is to investigate 
approaches for creating and rendering trees to be used in a real-time graphics 
application. \par
A key reason for wanting to include trees in computer generated environments is 
that trees, and other foliage, are what give life to that environment, a forest 
is not a forest without the trees and having an easy method of including trees 
in a landscape will mean that making that landscape more realistic and engaging 
becomes easier.

\subsection{Knowledge}
The key areas of knowledge required to complete this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Branch Growth - The technical knowledge to produce natural looking 
            branches will be most important to the success of this project, 
            if the branches of the trees do not look naturally shaped then 
            the final tree will not look realistic. \par
            The method used for naturally formed branches will be decided from 
            researching multiple sources to find a suitable algorithm that 
            can be implemented as efficiently as possible.
      \item Leaf Placement - Similarly to the issue of branch growth, the 
            placement of leaves on the tree branches will also be important 
            with respect to making the rendered trees look realistic. \par 
            The method chosen will also similarly be researched from multiple 
            sources to find the most appropriate algorithm for efficient 
            implementation.
      \item Texturing - The textures applied to the trees after the geometry 
            is finalised will not be as essential as the previous points but 
            it will still play a key role in making the trees look realistic.
            \par A method will need to be used to correctly apply a bark 
            texture to the trunk and branches of the tree without jarring 
            edges being noticeable. The same attention will also need to be 
            given to the leaf texture and the decision of whether to include 
            some transparency in the leaves.
      \item Branch Pathing - This can be grouped with the branch growth section 
            as a possible extension. The idea that an obstacle could be used 
            to obstruct the growth of the tree's branches and the branch growth 
            algorithm would take this into account and render the tree to look 
            it has grown to avoid the obstacle. \par 
            This would help the rendered trees properly integrate with the 
            environment they're placed in and add a more realistic feel.
      \item Root System - A possible inclusion would be a ground level root 
            system for the trees, not a fully rendered underground system as 
            that would be pointless, but some of the roots of larger trees 
            will be visible around the base of the tree. \par 
            Some variation could be added to the trees by not having them 
            magically sprout from the ground and instead showing some of the 
            ground roots. A method would have to be chosen to model this, 
            possibly using the sam method for the branches but reversed.
\end{itemize}
