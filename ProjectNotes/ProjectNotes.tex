\section*{Introduction}
This notebook will serve as a reference for all activites related to the completion
of my project. I will separate each entry by week, listing and describing everything
I did that week and how it will help my project progress.

\section*{Week 1 Sem 1, 28th Sept - 4th Oct}
This week I was introduced to the expectations for the project. I have started by 
scheduling a meeting with Stephen Laycock, my supervisor, and starting off my project 
proposal by doing some market research of similar software and reading some papers 
covering the subject of constructing trees using algorithms.

I have not yet decided any approach for the project due to being unsure what kind of 
aims I should be making, after my meeting with Stephen on the 5th I will hopefully 
know what route to be going down for the project.

\section*{Week 2 Sem 1, 5th Oct - 11th Oct}
After my meeting with Stephen on the 5th I am more aware of what direction I will be 
taking the project. I will be creating an OpenGL module that can be added into a 
project to allow for the construction of trees in whatever environment the user has 
created. There are many avenues of complexity I can go down but at the moment I have 
decided that my focus will be to have the branch creation be as realistic as possible 
and hopefully include some sort of obstacle avoidance system wherever the tree grows.
I have scheduled another meeting with Stephen for the same time next week on the 12th 
where we have agreed I should have completed the project proposal for review.

Nearing the end of the week I have completed my project proposal and sent it to 
Stephen for him to review and discuss in our meeting on the 12th. I have fleshed out 
more of my thoughts towards how I should approach the project.

\section*{Week 3 Sem 1, 12th Oct - 18th Oct}
During this weeks meeting with Stephen he provided me with feedback on my project 
proposal and we discussed moving on to the literature review. His comments about the 
proposal were very useful and his advice for the literature review has helped me 
understand the structure that I should use when writing it. I will be focusing on 
bringing together and comparing the content of multiple papers with respect to specific 
parts of my project such as tree branch construction or leaf placement etc.

The end of the week was used to start the introduction to my literature review where 
I described the project and discussed the required knowledge for completion of the 
project.

\section*{Week 4 Sem 1, 19th Oct - 25th Oct}
This weeks meeting with Stephen was used to discuss the introduction I sent him for 
the literature review and how to improve it, along with how I should proceed with the 
rest of the document. I have a better understanding of how I will be approaching the 
rest of the literature review now. I have also downloaded several papers related to 
the project that I will use for my comparisons in the rest of the document, I hope to 
have it finished by my next meeting with Stephen on the 26th.

Progress on the document did not proceed as quickly as I would have hoped. After 
evaluating the papers I downloaded I found that a few were not strictly relevant to 
the project and so had to remove them, leaving me with less content to use. Other 
obstacles prevented much work being done on the literature review but it is not 
expected until the end of next week so I am still on target.

\section*{Week 5 Sem 1, 26th Oct - 1st Nov}
This weeks meeting with Stephen wasn't as productive as I would've hoped due to me not 
making as much progress on the literature review as I wanted to. We discussed some of 
the upcoming sections in the review giving me a better understanding of what I should 
consider for content.

The second half of this week proved quite productive where I managed to write a lot 
of content relating to branch structure, leaf placement and wind affect with respect 
to various papers. This process has greatly improved my understanding of many of the 
key areas of knowledge that will be required in the design and implementation stage.

\section*{Week 6 Sem 1, 2nd Nov - 8th Nov}
This weeks meeting was used to discuss the content I had written in the latter half of 
Week 5. Unfortunately the review was not finished for the end of Week 5 but good progress 
has been made and I will be able to finish it in the next couple of days.

I have now completed the literature review and sent off my final draft to Stephen, the 
last content added was a comparison of work related to detail management with tree models, 
such as different approaches to LOD dropoff, and then a simple conclusion.

\section*{Week 7 Sem 1, 2nd Nov - 8th Nov}
During this weeks meeting Stephen and I discussed how I should proceed into the design and 
planning stage of the project and that including beginning to experiment with opengl 3D 
programming.

I have been making progress understanding some basics with opengl 3D programming 
gathering together the fundamentals for creating an application such as opening a window and 
setting clear colour. 

I will continue working to understand the general requirements for producing an opengl 
application during this week.

\section*{Week 8 Sem 1, 9th Nov - 15th Nov}
This week I have continued with more basic progress with the opengl application being able 
to load in objects and apply textures. I have also continued general research on various 
tree related 3D rendering methods to further my understanding. I have mostly been focussing 
on the work of Przemys≈Çaw Prusinkiewicz as his various work covers most facets of this subject.

\section*{Week 9 Sem 1, 16th Nov - 22nd Nov}
This week has been slower than previous as I have started working on producing generated shapes 
in my opengl application. I will need some sort of struct to generate lines for my branch 
structure that can be loaded in from certain points. 

I will continue to work on this and make as much progress as possible while beginning to write 
up the progress report for the project.

\section*{Week 10 Sem 1, 23rd Nov - 29th Nov}
This week I have been working on getting more general facets of the opengl application working 
such as a basic lighting setup and gaining a more thorough view of the opengl rendering 
pipeline which has helped me with understanding how the application should be written.

I have made decent progress on the progress report having added the introduction and the 
explanation for the problems of branch structure and leaf placement.

\section*{Week 11 Sem 1, 30th Nov - 6th Dec}
In this weeks meeting I received feedback from Stephen about the report and opengl program 
helping me understand how I should progress from here. 

I will be continuing to work on the progress report more having started on the design and 
planning stage of the report where I will discuss the method of L-systems. 

\section*{Week 12 Sem 1, 7th Dec - 13th Dec}
In this weeks meeting with Stephen we discussed the design and planning section I had started 
about L-systems. After some discussion we decided that I should rewrite this section with more 
detail for the L-system description.

I have done further research into L-systems while looking to write the design and planning stage 
and learned more about how I could possibly approach the implementation stage. I will likely 
change my design from using lines as a skeleton and then applying thickness afterwards. To 
producing an L-system that accounts for thickness of branches by using cylinders instead of lines.
