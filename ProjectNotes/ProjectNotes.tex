\section*{Introduction}
This notebook will serve as a reference for all activites related to the completion
of my project. I will separate each entry by week, listing and describing everything
I did that week and how it will help my project progress.

\section*{Week 1, 28th Sept - 4th Oct}
This week I was introduced to the expectations for the project. I have started by 
scheduling a meeting with Stephen Laycock, my supervisor, and starting off my project 
proposal by doing some market research of similar software and reading some papers 
covering the subject of constructing trees using algorithms. \par
I have not yet decided any approach for the project due to being unsure what kind of 
aims I should be making, after my meeting with Stephen on the 5th I will hopefully 
know what route to be going down for the project.

\section*{Week 2, 5th Oct - 11th Oct}
After my meeting with Stephen on the 5th I am more aware of what direction I will be 
taking the project. I will be creating an OpenGL module that can be added into a 
project to allow for the construction of trees in whatever environment the user has 
created. There are many avenues of complexity I can go down but at the moment I have 
decided that my focus will be to have the branch creation be as realistic as possible 
and hopefully include some sort of obstacle avoidance system wherever the tree grows.
I have scheduled another meeting with Stephen for the same time next week on the 12th 
where we have agreed I should have completed the project proposal for review. \par
Nearing the end of the week I have completed my project proposal and sent it to 
Stephen for him to review and discuss in our meeting on the 12th. I have fleshed out 
more of my thoughts towards how I should approach the project.

\section*{Week 3, 12th Oct - 18th Oct}
During this weeks meeting with Stephen he provided me with feedback on my project 
proposal and we discussed moving on to the literature review. His comments about the 
proposal were very useful and his advice for the literature review has helped me 
understand the structure that I should use when writing it. I will be focusing on 
bringing together and comparing the content of multiple papers with respect to specific 
parts of my project such as tree branch construction or leaf placement etc. \par
The end of the week was used to start the introduction to my literature review where 
I described the project and discussed the required knowledge for completion of the 
project.

\section*{Week 4, 19th Oct, 25th Oct}
This weeks meeting with Stephen was used to discuss the introduction I sent him for 
the literature review and how to improve it, along with how I should proceed with the 
rest of the document. I have a better understanding of how I will be approaching the 
rest of the literature review now. I have also downloaded several papers related to 
the project that I will use for my comparisons in the rest of the document, I hope to 
have it finished by my next meeting with Stephen on the 26th.
